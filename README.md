# Linear-Regression-From-Scratch
Linear Regression from scratch using Python — implements cost function, gradient descent, and visualizations to model Salary vs. Years of Experience, with comparison to Scikit-Learn’s results.

This project demonstrates how to build a simple linear regression model from scratch using Python, without relying on machine learning libraries. The dataset compares Years of Experience to Salary, and I manually implement:

- The model output function f(x)= wx + b
- The cost function J(w,b)
- Gradient Descent to optimize parameters
- 3D visualization of the cost function and convergence path
- A final comparison with Scikit-Learn’s LinearRegression for validation

Includes visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn for both the regression line and the cost landscape.
